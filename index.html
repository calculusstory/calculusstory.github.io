      <h2> By Charlotte Chen</h2><br>

      <div class="bodyText">

      <br>
      <p>  &emsp;&emsp;It was like any other day in Mathlandia. The well-renowned frog detective Cal Q. Lus was simply sipping his morning t, chatting with his partner, Shelldon the turtle. That is, until the phone rang. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“Dr. Lus,” the voice said. “Please come down to the local police station. We have a new case for you.” <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Though he didn’t need to work, Cal enjoyed taking time to investigate cases. But right now, Cal was annoyed. Any disturbance of Cal’s t was not welcomed. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Even then, he drove down in his Rolles Joyce with Shelldon in the passenger seat to the janky station. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“Dr. Lus. I’m glad you could make it.” It was Officer Matt Amatics. He was a portly French man, with bits of stubble poking out from his rounded face. His steely eyes always caught Cal a bit off guard.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“Here’s what we know.” He handed Cal a slim manilla file with crisp edges. “We looked through l’hôpital records. She checked in at 4:38 PM and died at around 6:00 PM. L’hôpital has reason to believe that Polly Nomial was poisoned. ” Officer Matt was hovering over Cal’s shoulder. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“Thank you, Matt.” Cal sat down and began to sift through the file. It didn’t take very long, as there was only one notable photo and one sparse report. There wasn’t much said in the report, but the photo held something interesting: there was some writing on Polly’s desk. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“It’s an equation. ” <br>
$$ f(x)= -t^3-10t^2-12t+5 $$
 </p>

     <div class="firstGraph">
       <iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qnveh3sw2t?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
     </div>
     <p>
       <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Cal was intrigued. He had always had an affinity for mathematics. In fact, Cal was the very same Cal Q. Lus that came up with the fundamental theorem of calculus. Cal was so proud of it that he had it embroidered on a pillow: “where you end up in life is composed of where you were plus all of the positive and negative change you accumulate.” It took Cal 3 weeks to complete, but it was well worth it. <br>
     &emsp;&emsp;But Cal never needed complex math in solving cases. A polynomial. He wondered why Polly would have that on her desk.<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;But of course, it made sense that she had math all around her. Polly was the most talented mathematician of her time. She was awarded the Fields Medal at the early age of 24 for her work on algebraic theorems. Every mathematician dreams of the medal, but few have the means and the creativity to have such work deserving of such a monumental award. <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; But first, Cal needed to examine potential suspects. Officer Matt had already interviewed all potential suspects (Cal hated doing the interviews). Cal looked through the files. There were 3 potential suspects: Alan (Attila) Gebra, Moe Nomial, and Rie Mann. <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>Alan (Attila) Gebra</i><br>
     &emsp;&emsp;- Has motive, competitor of Polly <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; - Works at police station <br>
     &emsp;&emsp;- Went for the Fields Medal but never got it and had his greatest mathematical achievement the same time Polly had hers <br>
     &emsp;&emsp;- Took a trip to Antarctica for research <br>
     	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>Moe Nomial</i> <br>
     &emsp;&emsp;- Polly’s twin brother <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; - Resents Polly for being so successful and always eclipsing him <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; - Not as interested in math (despite the Nomial family being known for excellent mathematics) <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; - Seems very distraught over Polly, weeping, doesn’t know who would want to do that to Polly <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; - Was on a u-sub trip to explore the great depths of the ocean for 5 months <br>

     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>Rie Mann</i> <br>
     &emsp;&emsp;- Worked with Polly during her great achievements <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;- Never was as famous as Polly <br>
     &emsp;&emsp;- Said she enjoyed working with Polly <br>
     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Seemed evasive <br>
     &emsp;&emsp;- Invited to board a trip to the moon (on account of being such a great mathematician) <br>

     &emsp;&emsp;According to the suspects, Polly was known to be meticulous in her behavior and habits. They doubted that Polly would ever do something like write on her desk in permanent ink. So why did she do it? They all recognized her script. Cal needed some help. He decided to send his math fairy friend, Becky a picture of the equation with the hope that she could help him. <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; “A message.” Pieyai hopped in with his signature cowboy hat. Officer Matt was confused, but he didn’t dare disturb the master brothers at work. Pieyai liked to hop in every once in a while to help Cal with his cases.<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;It surely had to be a message. Polly never did anything without meaning to, according to her brother. Pieyai pointed to the picture. Cal wondered what he was pointing to. After some more inspection, Cal noticed that in the uppermost corner of the equation, it had some writing.<br>
$$p+v$$
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;“She’s asking y’all to graph the position graph and its derivative!” said Pieyai. Yes! Cal knew that had to have been what Polly meant. Naturally, Cal then takes the derivative of the equation. Cal does this with the power rule, where you take the exponent of each term, multiply it by the coefficient and then take the exponent minus one. <br>
$$\frac{d}{dt}(-t^3+10t^2-12t+5)$$<br>
&emsp;&emsp;From the position graph, Cal gets:$$v(t)= -3t^2+20t-12$$ He now had to graph the equations!<br>
<br>
</p>
<div class="graph2">
  <iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7mrqmo7x7g?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>

</div>
     <p>
       <br>
       &emsp;&emsp;Once he graphed it, he was puzzled. It was an oblong shape. Cal frowned. What could it be? A feather? A baseball bat? A leaf? <br>
<br>
     </p>
     <div class="zoomin">
       <iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/9amzmbkpy3?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>

     </div>
<p>
  <br>
       &emsp;&emsp;“Well butter my biscuits, it’s a leaf!” ribbeted Pieyai. Cal knew Pieyai was right: Polly was fascinated with nature, with spirals and such. In particular, she was fascinated by European yew, a poisonous bush with branches full of leaves, oblong leaves. From afar, one wouldn’t be able to tell that the leaves and berries grew in a spiral, but Polly described the spiral in such mathematical detail that her peers had no choice but to admire her. <br>
       &emsp;&emsp;“I’ve given you everything you need to know. Toodles!” Pieyai tipped his cowboy hat and went on his merry way. <br>
       &emsp;&emsp;Dr. Lus examined the revolution again. Was Polly poisoned with European yew? If so, who did it? Cal needed more information. <br>
       &emsp;&emsp;“Did the autopsy results come back?” Cal asked.<br>
       &emsp;&emsp;Matt fumbled for the file folder and directed his attention towards the autopsy report. Cal was proven right in the one time he wanted to be wrong: Polly was poisoned with taxine alkaloids from the European yew plant. <br>
     </p>
     <img class="center" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Taxine_B.png" alt="Taxine">
     <p>
       &emsp;&emsp; Cal now knew that the equation Polly left behind had to be integral in solving this whodunnit. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Cal decided to see what else he could find out with the equation. Cal decided to figure out the movement of a particle on the graph from 0 to 6 (the first intercept of the velocity graph). First, Cal needed to find the critical points. He knew he could do this with the zeros of the velocity graph.
<br>
<br>
       </p>

<div class="velocity">
  <iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/auabprzgz2?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>

</div>
<p>
  <br>
  <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Then, Cal found the values of f(t) at the critical points and the endpoints.<br>
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Critical Points</th>
    <th>x(t)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>5</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.667</td>
    <td>1.148</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>77</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
<td>8.685</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><br>
  &emsp;&emsp;By subtracting x(0) and x(0.667), Cal concluded that the particle moved 3.85 units to the left. Then, Cal found the difference between x(6) and x(0.667) and found that the particle moved 75.852 units to the right. Cal did this again with x(6) and x(8.685)  and got 77 units to the left. This meant that Polly’s total distance was 156.7 (by adding all the values together). But what could the units and particle represent? <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Rather than an amphibian, a reptile was helping Cal this time: Shelldon came in with an answer! Shelldon said that the particle must represent Polly and the distance had to have been metries while the time was hours. Maybe the equation represented Polly’s movement throughout the day! <br>
&emsp;&emsp;If the graph was Polly’s movement, then her starting point must be her house! This also meant that her total displacement from 0 to 8.685 would represent where she ended up. Cal knew that to find the displacement, he just had to take the integral from 0 to 8.685 of the velocity graph!<br>
<br>
$$\int_0^{8.685}v(t)$$
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Cal took out his cal-culator and found that Polly’s displacement equaled -5.03! This seemed to correspond with the coordinate system that Mathlandia uses for locations! This meant that she ended up 5.03 metries left of her house!<br>
&emsp;&emsp;What about the second derivative? Cal thought it might be helpful to find the second derivative. So he did, with the power rule!<br>
$$\frac{d}{dt}(-3t^2+20t-12)$$
$$a(t)=-6t+20$$
<br>

<p>
  <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Cal tried to graph speed next by taking the absolute value of the velocity graph.<br>
  $$|v(t)|$$

  &emsp;&emsp;Cal was trying to piece together Polly’s day with all the information he could gather from the equation.

&emsp;&emsp;  Cal then decided to graph the particle motion with Desmos. Cal decided upon a vertical illustration so that the graphs could be side by side even though he knew it would in reality be horizontal.

</div>
<p><br><br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Cal, with his gift of intuition, was able to put the puzzle pieces together from the equation. From her house, Polly decided to walk to the local bookstore just 3.85 metries to the left. Since Polly rarely had the opportunity to exercise, she tired very easily and was walking slowly. After she checked out some books from the library (corroborated by library records) Polly got a ride from a friend of hers at the library, but then her friend arrived at home after traveling 41.7 metries and Polly continued to her destination by foot. From the bookstore, she traveled 75.85 metries to the right before she ran back. But where was that?<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Cal decided to pull out his handy dandy map of Mathlandia and looked for anything 75 metries right of Polly’s house. Tracing his webbed foot, Cal found it! Of course: it was Rie’s pi bakery!<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Shelldon loved the pi there and Cal enjoyed the t. Polly wasn’t a big fan of sweets though. Why did she visit Rie’s bakery? And also, why was she accelerating towards it? Maybe Shelldon knew. Shelldon loved the pi so much that he visited nearly every day.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“Ah, yes. Polly was there. I remember that she was talking with someone about something." <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Cal decided to contact the person temporarily running Rie’s bakery to see what Polly ordered if anything at all. So it seems that Polly ordered a salad (at a bakery?! What strange choices Polly made). That must have been where the murderer snuck in the European yew leaf! Cal asked if Shelldon remembered who she was talking to and about what, but Shelldon just shrugged and said he didn’t know.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Cal decided to see what else he could do with the equation. He thought about the suspects and how they could have gained access to the European Yew. Alan Gebra, Moe Nomial, Rie Mann. That’s it, Cal thought! Maybe he needed to take a Riemann sum of the graph! Cal decided it made the most sense to take it from 0 to the first intercept. Cal wasn’t sure how to take a Riemann sum, but he remembered that it had something to do with using rectangles to take area. Cal decided to ask Shelldon.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;“You use rectangles to approximate area! You can do LAM (left approximation method) or RAM (right approximation method), which means coming from the left or right, or even use trapezoids instead of rectangles!<br>

<br>
</p>
<div class="rie">
  <iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hidbmiyiu6?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
</div>
<p>
  <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;“But why don’t you just take the integral from 0 to the first intercept?” Shelldon asked. “That would make it a lot faster and easier, since you don’t need an approximation, and the graph is continuous!” <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Cal decided to take Shelldon’s advice.<br>
$$\int_0^{8.685}x(t)$$
&emsp;&emsp;The value of the integral was 352.125975. Cal was puzzled. What did this number have to do with anything?<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“Year!” piped Shelldon. A year? Why a year? Cal thought. There were 365 days in a year. Then it made sense: Polly was pointing to a specific day! So the 352nd day… December 18th!<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Cal sifts through the evidence found at the scene. Aha! Cal found Polly’s planner. He paged through the neatly filled boxes and finds December 18th of last year. The National Math Symposium, of course! But Alan Gebra didn’t attend this year, Cal remembered. Al was on sabbatical in Antarctica, and plus, Alan was an officer at the police station!<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Cal thought. Maybe the graphs had more than one meaning! Cal decided to look at concavity. Based on the first derivative graph, the position graph went from concave up to concave down at t = 3.33. What could it mean?<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Maybe it represented the time at which Polly was poisoned! And her condition went downhill from there! Maybe it represented the reduced depolarization of the action potential associated with taxine poisoning! <br>
<br>
</p>
<div class="pos2">
  <iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/irw5h4oqhv?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>

</div>

<p>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Cal looked at the acceleration graph again.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<div class="accel3">
  <iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/k0f7qjll0n?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
</div>
<p>
  <br>
&emsp;&emsp;The autopsy read that Polly’s estimated time of departure was 6:00 PM, which lined up with the graph.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;It all made sense: the rate of depolarization of the action potential decreased, perfectly in line with the symptoms of taxine alkaloid poisoning.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Cal tried to think about the suspects that were present at the time. But Rie Mann wasn’t even near Polly, in the state, in the country, or even on the earth. Rie was specially invited to board a spaceship for a trip to the moon, and left the bakery to be run by Rie’s friends. That just left Moe Nomial. Could Moe have done it? Cal looked back to his notes on his interviewing of Moe. Moe wasn’t at the math symposium or in the area at 3:33. He had been in a u-sub for months trying to apply math to the undocumented depths of the sea. None of the suspects could have done it. If not them, then who? <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Cal needed to try to find more information. Cal tried to find the area between two curves, the position graph and the velocity graph.<br>
<br>
</p>


    <div class="areabwcurve">
<iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ggzm6caggp?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
        </div>
     <p>
       <br>
      &emsp;&emsp; Cal knew he could do this by taking the integral of the higher curve minus the lower curve, given the points of intersection.
      $$\int_{0.742}^{2.3}(v(t)-(x(t))$$
      &emsp;&emsp;<b>5.3118.</b> The number looked familiar. Cal couldn’t remember where he recognized that number. He then decided to revolve the area. <br>
  <br>

    </p>

      <div class="revolvearea">
        <iframe class="center" src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0r0v5i54nj?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
      </div>

      <p>
        <br>

       &emsp;&emsp;It seemed like a derivative of a familiar shape. Cal couldn’t compute it.<br>

  <br>
     </p>


       <p>
         <br>
         Then, the answer hit Cal. With dread in his heart, he realized what these familiar shapes and numbers were. The shape was Shelldon’s shell flipped upside down. 5/31/18 was Shelldon’s birthday. But it couldn’t be. Could it? Cal stared into the pitch-black eyes of his turtle best friend. Could Shelldon have been the one to sneak the leaf into Polly’s salad? Could it be?
         	Then, Shelldon donned a sinister smile. “Took you long enough.”

 <div class="postScript">
   &emsp;&emsp; This website hosts the greatest story created my Charlotte Chen for her AP Calculus BC class.<br><br>
  &emsp;&emsp; <b>How did you choose the context for your story? Is this a realistic scenario? Explain.<br></b>
I really wanted to create a story that was entertaining on its own, something that didn’t just exist to be a school project. I brainstormed a bunch of ideas as to what story I should make and of all of the possibilities, this seemed the most interesting and appealing. Also, watching Mathnet last year might have slightly inspired me! Of all the possible scenarios, this is probably one of the most unlikely. How likely is it that a frog detective’s turtle friend turns out to be the murderer of a math genius discovered through math? Not very likely. I think to really capture creative aspects along with interesting pieces, absurdity and unrealistic plot points work to this project’s advantage.
&emsp;&emsp;<b>Where else could you see connections to calculus in context being made – that might not be so obvious?<br></b>
I think that connections to calculus could be made anywhere, outside the context of a calculus or physics classroom. Some that might not be so obvious? It might be included in construction/architecture (although that seems awfully connected to physics) in terms of the necessary movements of machinery. I think calculus could be very helpful in any given piece of machinery used to produce anything. Another possibility is connected to music and the travelling of sound waves. As a violin player, I can imagine the vibrations of strings connected to the speed of sound, and how the orientation of a violin can impact the velocity and acceleration of soundwaves (still very calculus and physics based). I guess it’s difficult to find an example that isn’t obviously connected to physics or calculus in some way, shape, or form!
<br>&emsp;&emsp;<b> How has your story contributed to your understanding/reinforcement of calculus?<br></b>
Writing this story has helped me to see calculus in a different light. Sure, I knew that many of the basic graphs involved motion and how a particle moves, but the focus in class was never solely on the motion of something. Through writing, I’ve come to understand the actual connections between the math and our very real world of motion in a more concrete way. The more you use something, the more you understand it. I’ve spent an unreal amount of time laboring over this project, allowing myself to (hopefully) absorb more calculus. Although my story isn’t quite as chock full of puns as I had initially hoped, I’ve learned that a story doesn’t need to have puns in every sentence to be readable.
What have you learned as a result of completing this project/process?
Although this may not have been the intended lesson of this project/process, I learned the importance of organization and planning. I made the not so wise decision to create my project without a second glance at the rubric and what the assignment was. I also wasted a lot of precious time prematurely putting pieces of story into a coding editor before finalizing the story and the logistics of the graphs. I think that if I really planned out what I was going to do and when, I would not be answering these questions outside of class. Time management is always important, but management coupled with organization would have made this process a whole lot easier and less time consuming for me.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Do any other questions arise? What are they and why?<br></b>
Where is calculus most commonly used? My initial assumption is physics, as it is truly so integrated with motion and studying that motion, but I think it would be really cool to see where else calculus is often used. I’m also curious to hear what other people got out of this project. With it being such a highly creative and individual piece of work, I think the lessons learned are very different from person to person.
