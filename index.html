      <h2> By Charlotte Chen</h2><br>

      <div class="bodyText">

      <br>
      <p>  &emsp;&emsp;It was like any other day. The reclusive Cal Q. Lus was simply sipping his morning t, petting his turtle, Shelldon. That is, until the phone rang. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“Dr. Lus,” the voice said. “Please come down to the local police station. We have a new case for you.” <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Though he didn’t need to work, Cal enjoyed taking time to investigate cases. But right now, Cal was annoyed. Any disturbance of Cal’s t was not welcomed. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Even then, he drove down in his Rolles Joyce with Shelldon in the passenger seat to the janky station. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“Dr. Lus. I’m glad you could make it.” It was Officer Matt Amatics. He was a portly French man, with bits of stubble poking out from his rounded face. His steely eyes always caught Cal a bit off guard.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“Here’s what we know.” He handed Cal a slim manilla file with crisp edges. “We looked through l’hôpital records. She checked in at 4:38 PM and died at around 6:00PM. L’hôpital has reason to believe that Polly Nomial was poisoned. ” Officer Matt was hovering over Cal’s shoulder. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“Thank you, Matt.” Cal sat down and began to sift through the file. It didn’t take very long, as there was only one notable photo and one sparse report. There wasn’t much said in the report, but the photo held something interesting: there was some writing on the Polly’s desk. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“It’s an equation. ” <br>
$$ f(x)= t^3 - 12t^2 + 27t + 20 $$

     </div>
     <p>
       <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Cal was intrigued. He had always had an affinity for mathematics (his doctorate was in mathematics), but never had he needed complex math in solving cases. A polynomial. He wondered why Polly would have that on her desk. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;But of course, it made sense that she had math all around her. Polly was the most talented mathematician of her time. She was awarded the Fields Medal at the early age of 24 for her work on algebraic theorems. Every mathematician dreams of the medal, but few have the means and the creativity to have such work deserving of such a monumental award.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;But first, Cal needed to examine potential suspects. Officer Matt had already interviewed all potential suspects (Cal hated doing the interviews). Cal looked through the files. There were 3 potential suspects: Al Gebra, Moe Nomial, and Rie Mann.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; <i>Al Gebra</i><br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Has motive, competitor of Polly<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Went for the Fields Medal but never got it and had his greatest mathematical achievement the same time Polly had hers<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Took a trip to Antarctica for research<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Seems aggressive, doesn’t want to be here<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;<i>Moe Nomial</i><br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Polly’s twin brother<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Resents Polly for being so successful and always eclipsing him<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Not as interested in math (despite the Nomial family being known for excellent mathematics)<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Seems very distraught over Polly, weeping, doesn’t know who would want to do that to Polly<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Was on a u-sub trip to explore the great depths of the ocean for 5 months<br>

	&emsp;&emsp;<i>Rie Mann</i><br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Worked with Polly during her great achievements<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Never was as famous as Polly<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Said she enjoyed working with Polly<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; - Seemed evasive<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; - Invited to board a trip to the moon (on account of being such a great mathematician)<br>

	&emsp;&emsp;According to the suspects, Polly was known to be meticulous in her behavior and habits. They doubted that Polly would ever do something like write on her desk in permanent ink. So why did she do it? They all recognized her script.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“A message.” Pieyai hopped in with his signature cowboy hat. Officer Matt was confused, but he didn’t dare disturb the master at work. Pieyai liked to hop in every once in a while to help Cal with his cases.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;It surely had to be a message. Polly never did anything without meaning to, according to her brother. Pieyai pointed to the picture. Cal wondered what he was pointing to. After some more inspection, Cal noticed a small symbol next to the equation. It looked like an arrow curved in a circle. What could it mean?<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“Turning? Refreshing? Spinning? Revolving?”<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;“She’s asking y’all to revolve!” said Pieyai. Yes! Revolving! Cal knew that had to have been what Polly meant. He now had to revolve the graph of the equation!<br>
<br>
</p>
<div class="graph2">
  <iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fuzj42yiz4?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>

</div>
     <p>
       <br>
       &emsp;&emsp;Once he graphed it, he was puzzled. It was an oblong shape. Cal frowned. What could it be? A feather? A baseball bat? A leaf? <br>

       &emsp;&emsp;“Well butter my biscuits, it’s a leaf!” ribbeted Pieyai. Cal knew Pieyai was right: Polly was fascinated with nature, with spirals and such. In particular, she was fascinated by European yew, a poisonous bush with branches full of leaves, oblong leaves. From afar, one wouldn’t be able to tell that the leaves and berries grew in a spiral, but Polly described the spiral in such mathematical detail that her peers had no choice but to admire her. <br>
       &emsp;&emsp;“I’ve given you everything you need to know. Toodles!” Pieyai tipped his cowboy hat and went on his merry way. <br>
       &emsp;&emsp;Dr. Lus examined the revolution again. Was Polly poisoned with European yew? If so, who did it? Cal needed more information. <br>
       &emsp;&emsp;“Did the autopsy results come back?” Cal asked.<br>
       &emsp;&emsp;Matt fumbled for the file folder and directed his attention towards the autopsy report. Cal was proven right in the one time he wanted to be wrong: Polly was poisoned with taxine alkaloids from the European yew plant. Cal now knew that the answer to this whodunit was in the equation Polly left behind. <br>
       &emsp;&emsp;Cal decided to see what he could do with the equation. He thought about the suspects and how they could have gained access to the European Yew. Al Gebra, Moe Nomial, Rie Mann. That’s it, Cal thought! He needed to take a Riemann sum of the graph! Cal decided it made the most sense to take it from 0 to the first intercept.<br>
<br>
       </p>
<div class="riemannsum">
  <iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rw4v81yfyk?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
</div>
     <p>
       <br>
      &emsp;&emsp;The value of the Riemann sum was 352.125975. Cal was puzzled. What did this number have to do with anything? Rather than an amphibian, a reptile was helping Cal this time: Shelldon came in with an answer! <br>
      &emsp;&emsp;“Year!” piped Shelldon. A year? Why a year? Cal thought. There were 365 days in a year. Then it made sense: Polly was pointing to a specific day! So the 352nd day… December 18th! <br>
      &emsp;&emsp;Cal sifts through the evidence found at the scene. Aha! Cal found Polly’s planner. He paged through the neatly filled boxes and finds December 18th of last year. The National Math Symposium, of course! But Al Gebra didn’t attend this year, Cal remembered. Al was on sabbatical in Antartica finds Polly’s planner and finds December 18th of last year. Math symposium. This rules out Moe Nomial as a possible suspect, as Moe was on sabbatical in Antarctica. <br>
      &emsp;&emsp;Naturally, Cal then takes the derivative of the equation and gets: <br>
      $$3t^2-24t+27$$ <br>

      </p>
      <div class="derivative">
  <iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/j6rlepz52n?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
      </div>
<p>
  <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Cal thought. Cal decided to look at concavity. Based on the first derivative graph, the position graph went from concave up to concave down at t = 3.33. What could it mean?<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Maybe it represented the time at which Polly was poisoned! And her condition went downhill from there! The autopsy read that Polly’s estimated time of departure was 6:00 PM, which lined up with the graph. <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Cal tried to think about the suspects that were present at the time. But Rie Mann wasn’t even near Polly, in the state, in the country, or even on the earth. Rie was specially invited to board a spaceship for a trip to the moon. That just left Moe Nomial. Could Moe have done it? Cal looked back to his notes on his interviewing of Moe. Moe wasn’t at the math symposium or in the area at 3:33. He had been in a u-sub for months trying to apply math to the undocumented depths of the sea. None of the suspects could have done it. If not them, then who? <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Cal needed to try to find more information. Cal tried to find the area between two curves, the position graph and the velocity graph. <br>
<br>
</p>
    <div class="areabwcurve">
<iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ggzm6caggp?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
        </div>
     <p>
       <br>
      &emsp;&emsp; <b>5.3118.</b> The number looked familiar. Cal couldn’t remember where he recognized that number. He then decided to revolve the area. <br>
  <br>

    </p>

      <div class="revolvearea">
        <iframe class="center" src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0r0v5i54nj?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
      </div>

      <p>
        <br>

       &emsp;&emsp;It created a familiar shape. Cal couldn’t figure it out.<br>
 	&emsp;&emsp;Cal decided to look at the movement of a particle on the graph Polly left. <br>
  <br>
     </p>

       <div class="particlemvt">
         <iframe class="center"src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ubqti49v6e?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>   </div>

       <p>
         <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<b>3.85 to the left, and then 75.852 units to the right. </b><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Then, the answer hit Cal. With dread in his heart, he realized what these familiar shapes and numbers were. 3.85 left and 75.852 right mimicked Shelldon’s walk pattern. The shape was Shelldon’s shell flipped upside down. 5/31/18 was Shelldon’s birthday. But it couldn’t be. Could it? Cal stared into the pitch-black eyes of his turtle. Could it be? <br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Then, Shelldon donned a sinister smile. “Took you long enough.” <br>
<br>
